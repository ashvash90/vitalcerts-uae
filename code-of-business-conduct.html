            <p>We understand that by using our services, you have to be comfortable in putting your trust in us. Trust
              is a difficult emotion to gain from anyone, or another company, in particular if you don't have anything
              to back up the feeling. This is where our Code of Business Conduct comes in.

            <p>We have gone to great lengths to organise our business in a professional manner, to ensure that we treat
              every customer, partner and colleague in a fair and consistent manner. We want you to know how important
              you are to us.

            <p>You can download our Code of Business Conduct here that details how we work, in the UAE and around the
              world, what our beliefs are, and hopefully how that benefits you. This is an internal document which every
              staff member has to sign when they join us, and is shared with you as our commitment to openness.</p>
