            <p>When you visit Vital Certificates or make use of our services you automatically receive one or more
              cookies. The primary purpose for our use of cookies is to ensure the optimal delivery of our services. In
              addition, we use third party cookies for statistics and to analyse user behaviour. This policy explains in
              more detail the types of cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and how you can block and
              remove such cookies.</p>

            <h3 class="font-secondary color-primary-darker">What&#39;s a cookie?</h3>

            <p>A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer&#39;s hard drive and which records how
              you move your way around a website so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored options
              based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for
              advertising and marketing purposes.</p>

            <p>Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system.</p>

            <p>If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your
              browser settings. You can block cookies at any time by activating the setting on your browser that allows
              you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all
              cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access certain parts of our site.</p>

            <h3 class="font-secondary color-primary-darker">Blocking and removing cookies</h3>

            <p>Your browser may give you the ability to block or delete cookies should you wish to do so. Please see the
              &lsquo;Help&rsquo; menu in your browser for further information. Please note that blocking all cookies
              will have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including our own. We therefore recommend
              that you permit the use of cookies when using our websites.</p>

            <h3 class="font-secondary color-primary-darker">How do we use cookies?</h3>

            <p>We use cookies to track your use of our website. This enables us to understand how you use the site and
              track any patterns with regards how you are using our website. This helps us to develop and improve our
              website as well as products and / or services in response to what you might need or want.</p>

            <p>Our site makes use of both <strong>session</strong> and <strong>persistent</strong> cookies.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Session cookies</strong> are only stored on your computer during your web session and are
                automatically
                deleted when you close your browser &ndash; they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to
                browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any personal data from
                your computer; or</li>
              <li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> are stored as files on your computer and remain there when you
                close your
                web browser. The cookie can be read by our website to recognise you when you make return visits to us.
                Persistent cookies placed on your computer as a result of your use of our websites will never be stored
                for longer than 2 years from the date of your last visit. We use persistent cookies for Google
                Analytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The table below sets out the various types of cookies we use in more detail, why we (or relevant third
              parties) use them, and includes information you can use to control and learn more about the cookies used
              on our site.</p>
